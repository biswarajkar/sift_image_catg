%This function will predict the category for every test image by finding
%the training image with most similar features. Instead of 1 nearest
%neighbor, we will vote based on k nearest neighbors which will increase
%performance.

%function predicted_categories = nearest_neighbor_classify(train_image_feats, training_labels, test_image_feats)
function predicted_categories = nearest_neighbor_classify()
% image_feats is an N x d matrix, where d is the dimensionality of the
%  feature representation.
% train_labels is an N x 1 cell array, where each entry is a string
%  indicating the ground truth category for each training image.
% test_image_feats is an N x d matrix, where d is the dimensionality of the
%  feature representation.
% predicted_categories is an N x 1 cell array, where each entry is a string
%  indicating the predicted category for each test image.

%{
Useful functions:
 matching_indices = strcmp(string, cell_array_of_strings)
   This can tell you which indices in train_labels match a particular
   category. Not necessary for simple one nearest neighbor classifier.

 D = vl_alldist2(X,Y) 
    http://www.vlfeat.org/matlab/vl_alldist2.html
    returns the pairwise distance matrix D of the columns of X and Y. 
    D(i,j) = sum (X(:,i) - Y(:,j)).^2
    Note that vl_feat represents points as columns vs this code (and Matlab
    in general) represents points as rows. So you probably want to use the
    transpose operator ' 
   vl_alldist2 supports different distance metrics which can influence
   performance significantly. The default distance, L2, is fine for images.
   CHI2 tends to work well for histograms.
 
  [Y,I] = MIN(X) if you're only doing 1 nearest neighbor, or
  [Y,I] = SORT(X) if you're going to be reasoning about many nearest
  neighbors

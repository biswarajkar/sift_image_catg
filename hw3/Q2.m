% Localize a cylinder in the point cloud. Given a point cloud as input, this
% function should locate the position and orientation, and radius of the
% cylinder.
% input: ptCloud -> a pointCloud object that contains the point cloud (see
%                   Matlab documentation)
% output: center -> 3x1 vector denoting cylinder center
%         axis -> 3x1 unit vector pointing along cylinder axis
%         radius -> scalar radius of cylinder
function [center,axis,radius] = Q2(ptCloud)
